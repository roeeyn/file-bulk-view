# File Bulk View Files For GitHub PR Reviews

With this Chrome extension, you can conveniently mark multiple files as viewed or unviewed within a GitHub PR review, all with a single click.

## Description

This tool enhances the review bar by introducing an additional button, extending your control with a variety of powerful options:

- Setting all files to 'viewed'
- Reverting all files to 'unviewed'
- Applying 'viewed' status to all matches of a regex pattern
- Setting all matches of a regex pattern to 'unviewed'

This is based on multiple [comments](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github/issues/2444#issuecomment-571356496) on other extensions

## Example

The functions of this feature are intuitive. To make use of the filter functionality, simply provide a regular expression and perform an action by clicking `Match`. As an illustration, if you're seeking to filter out all `vendor` files within your PR review, simply input `vendor*`. This will promptly match and filter all files beginning with `vendor`.

## Feedback and Support
